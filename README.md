## Rules

The rules of Blackjack are simple:

- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- Number cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what benefits the player more.
- Each player starts with two cards, and the dealer has one card face up and one face down.
- Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
- If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.
- The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.

## Example Gameplay
